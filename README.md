# Dot Files

Welcome to my dot files

## Work in Progress

A ton of files here are inspired by other users. Hoping to start porting over more
files that might be useful going forward.

##
My set up currently uses the following:
0. Windows
1. WSL2
2. Ubuntu
3. Neovim

I used to mainly code on Sublime Text 3, but am moving trying to move over to Vim.


## Install key components
- Install WSL2 + Ubuntu
	1. Using search in the Windows start menu, type features and click on "Turn Window features on or off"
	2. Enable Windows Subsystem for Linux
	3. Download Terminal from Windows Store
	4. Install Ubuntu
	5. Remember to update Ubuntu first

- Install neovim
	```
	sudo apt install neovim
	```

- Install python & node support
	```
	pip install pyn vim

	```
	```
	npm i -g neovim
	```
